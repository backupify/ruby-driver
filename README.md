## How to test the Backupify fork of the datastax driver

### To see the difference between our fork and mainline, look at this URL:

[The diff](https://github.com/datastax/ruby-driver/compare/v3.0.0...backupify:3.0.0-port_support)

### A few notes for context:

Using binding.pry, I saw that `lib/cassandra/cluster/control_connection.rb`'s `refresh_metadata_async`
method gets called when a cluster is created:

```ruby
cluster = Cassandra.cluster(client_config)
```

Without our patch, after `refresh_metadata_async` is called, it's possible for a 
`Backupify::Stunnel::IPAddrWithPort` to become a regular `IPAddr` and therefore lose 
its port number.

Following through the code in `backupify/` that creates CQL/Cass2 connections, 
this is the series of events:

```ruby
datastore_config = Backupify::DatastoreConfig.new('cass_datastores').for_datastore('storage_metadata');

cluster_config = datastore_config[:cluster_config];

client_config = { :synchronize_schema => false, };
client_config[:port] = cluster_config[:port] if cluster_config[:port];

if cluster_config[:address_resolution_policy]
  client_config[:address_resolution_policy] = cluster_config[:address_resolution_policy].constantize
end;

if cluster_config[:use_resolved_addresses]
  client_config[:hosts] = client_config[:address_resolution_policy].resolved_addresses
else
  client_config[:hosts] = cluster_config[:hosts]
end;

[:connections_per_local_node, :connections_per_remote_node].each do |opt_name|
  next unless value = cluster_config[opt_name]
  client_config[opt_name] = value
end;

if cluster_config.keys.include?(:idle_timeout.to_s)
  client_config[:idle_timeout] = cluster_config[:idle_timeout]
end;

load_balancing = Cassandra::LoadBalancing::Policies::WhiteList.new(
  client_config[:hosts].sample(3),
  Cassandra::LoadBalancing::Policies::RoundRobin.new)
client_config[:load_balancing_policy] = load_balancing;
client_config[:consistency] = :quorum;

# this is where refresh_metadata_async gets called
cluster = Cassandra.cluster(client_config);
```

So that's the series of calls.

### Testing our patch

Put a worker in maintenance mode.

Make a branch of backupify and change the Gemfile so that this version of the
datastax driver gets used:

```
# Our fork of the Datastax Cassandra Gem. The Datastax Cassandra Gem assumes that
# if you are using a different port for Cassandra, you are using that different
# port for all hosts. Our fork allows a different port for each Cassandra host.
gem 'cassandra-driver', :git => 'git@github.com:backupify/ruby-driver.git', :branch => '3.0.0-rc.2-port_support'
```

Deploy your branch to the worker you put in maintenance mode.

Get a Rails console going on the worker you put into maintenance mode.

To see the list of IPs in the registry, do this:

```ruby
control_connection = cluster.instance_variable_get(:@control_connection);
registry = control_connection.instance_variable_get(:@registry);
```

To prove that existing ips didn't get replaced with IPAddr, run this:

```ruby
registry.hosts.each do |h|
  port = if h.ip.class == Backupify::Stunnel::IPAddrWithPort
    h.ip.port
  else
    0
  end
  puts "#{h.ip.class} #{h.ip.to_s}:#{port}"
end;

You will see this:

```
Backupify::Stunnel::IPAddrWithPort 127.0.0.81:27526
Backupify::Stunnel::IPAddrWithPort 127.0.0.58:27474
Backupify::Stunnel::IPAddrWithPort 127.0.0.67:27494
...
```

YOU SHOULD NOT SEE THIS:

```
Backupify::Stunnel::IPAddrWithPort 127.0.0.54:27468
Backupify::Stunnel::IPAddrWithPort 127.0.0.7:27538
IPAddr 127.0.0.67:0 ## <--- oops!
Backupify::Stunnel::IPAddrWithPort 127.0.0.82:27528
Backupify::Stunnel::IPAddrWithPort 127.0.0.66:27492
...
```

[Check out the slides from Ruby Driver Explained](https://speakerdeck.com/avalanche123/ruby-driver-explained) for a detailed overview of the Ruby Driver architecture.

## Compatibility

This driver works exclusively with the Cassandra Query Language v3 (CQL3) and Cassandra's native protocol. The current version works with:

* Apache Cassandra versions 1.2, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, and 3.x
* DataStax Enterprise 4.0 and above.
* Ruby (MRI) 2.2, 2.3
* JRuby 1.7

__Note__: JRuby 1.6 is not officially supported, although 1.6.8 should work. Similarly,
MRI 2.0 and 2.1 are not officially supported, but they should work. 1.9.3 is deprecated
and is likely to break in the release following 3.0.

## Quick start

```ruby
require 'cassandra'

cluster = Cassandra.cluster # connects to localhost by default

cluster.each_host do |host| # automatically discovers all peers
  puts "Host #{host.ip}: id=#{host.id} datacenter=#{host.datacenter} rack=#{host.rack}"
end

keyspace = 'system'
session  = cluster.connect(keyspace) # create session, optionally scoped to a keyspace, to execute queries

future = session.execute_async('SELECT keyspace_name, table_name FROM system_schema.tables') # fully asynchronous api
future.on_success do |rows|
  rows.each do |row|
    puts "The keyspace #{row['keyspace_name']} has a table called #{row['table_name']}"
  end
end
future.join
```

__Note__: The host you specify is just a seed node, the driver will automatically discover all peers in the cluster.

* [`Cassandra.cluster` options](http://datastax.github.io/ruby-driver/api/#cluster-class_method)
* [`Session#execute_async` options](http://datastax.github.io/ruby-driver/api/session/#execute_async-instance_method)
* [Usage documentation](http://datastax.github.io/ruby-driver/features)

## Installation

Install via rubygems

```bash
gem install cassandra-driver
```

Install via Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'cassandra-driver'
```

__Note__: if you want to use compression you should also install [snappy](http://rubygems.org/gems/snappy) or [lz4-ruby](http://rubygems.org/gems/lz4-ruby). [Read more about compression.](http://datastax.github.io/ruby-driver/features/#compression)


## Upgrading from cql-rb

Some of the new features added to the driver have unfortunately led to changes in the original cql-rb API. In the examples directory, you can find [an example of how to wrap the ruby driver to achieve almost complete interface parity with cql-rb](https://github.com/datastax/ruby-driver/blob/master/examples/cql-rb-wrapper.rb) to assist you with gradual upgrade.

## What's new in v3.0.0

### Features:

* Add support for Apache Cassandra native protocol v4
* Add support for smallint, tinyint, date (`Cassandra::Date`) and time (`Cassandra::Time`) data types.
* Include schema metadata for User Defined Functions and User Defined Aggregates.
* Augment the `Cassandra::Table` object to expose many more attributes: `id`, `options`, `keyspace`, `partition_key`, `clustering_columns`, and `clustering_order`. This makes it significantly easier to write administration scripts that report various attributes of your schema, which may help to highlight areas for improvement.
* Include client ip addresses in request traces, only on Cassandra 3.x.
* Add new retry policy decision `Cassandra::Retry::Policy#try_next_host`.
* Support specifying statement idempotence with the new `idempotent` option when executing.
* Support sending custom payloads when preparing or executing statements using the new `payload` option.
* Expose custom payloads received with responses on server exceptions and `Cassandra::Execution::Info` instances.
* Expose server warnings on server exceptions and `Cassandra::Execution::Info` instances.
* Add `connections_per_local_node`, `connections_per_remote_node`, `requests_per_connection` cluster configuration options to tune parallel query execution and resource usage.
* Add `Cassandra::Logger` class to make it easy for users to enable debug logging in the client.
* Add `protocol_version` configuration option to allow the user to force the protocol version to use for communication with nodes.
* Add support for materialized views and indexes in the schema metadata.
* Support the `ReadError`, `WriteError`, and `FunctionCallError` Cassandra error responses introduced in Cassandra 2.2.
* Add support for unset variables in bound statements.
* Support DSE security (`DseAuthenticator`, configured for LDAP).
* Add a timeout option to `Cassandra::Future#get`.

### Breaking Changes from 2.x:

* `Cassandra::Future#join` is now an alias to Cassandra::Future#get and will raise an error if the future is resolved with one.
* Default consistency level is now LOCAL_ONE.
* Enable tcp no-delay by default.
* Unavailable errors are retried on the next host in the load balancing plan by default.
* Statement execution no longer retried on timeouts, unless the statement is marked as idempotent in the call to `Cassandra::Session#execute*` or when creating a `Cassandra::Statement` object. 
* `Cassandra::Statements::Batch#add` and `Cassandra::Session#execute*` signatures have changed in how one specifies query parameters. Specify the query parameters array as the value of the arguments key:
 
```ruby
batch.add(query, ['val1', 'val2'])
# becomes
batch.add(query, arguments: ['val1', 'val2'])

batch.add(query, {p1: 'val1'})
# becomes
batch.add(query, arguments: {p1: 'val1'})
```
* The Datacenter-aware load balancing policy (`Cassandra::LoadBalancing::Policies::DCAwareRoundRobin`) defaults to using
  nodes in the local DC only. In prior releases, the policy would fall back to remote nodes after exhausting local nodes.
  Specify a positive value (or nil for unlimited) for `max_remote_hosts_to_use` when initializing the policy to allow remote node use.
* Unspecified variables in statements previously resulted in an exception. Now they are essentially ignored or treated as null.

### Bug Fixes:

* [[RUBY-120](https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/RUBY-120)] Tuples and UDTs can be used in sets and hash keys.
* [[RUBY-143](https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/RUBY-143)] Retry querying system table for metadata of new hosts when prior attempts fail, ultimately enabling use of new hosts.
* [[RUBY-150](https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/RUBY-150)] Fixed a protocol decoding error that occurred when multiple messages are available in a stream.
* [[RUBY-151](https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/RUBY-151)] Decode incomplete UDTs properly.
* [[RUBY-155](https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/RUBY-155)] Request timeout timer should not include request queuing time.
* [[RUBY-161](https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/RUBY-161)] Protocol version negotiation in mixed version clusters should not fall back to v1 unless it is truly warranted.
* [[RUBY-214](https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/RUBY-214)] Ensure client timestamps have microsecond precision in JRuby. Previously, some row updates would get lost in high transaction environments.

## Feedback Requested

*Help us focus our efforts!* [Provide your input](http://goo.gl/forms/pCs8PTpHLf) on the Ruby Driver Platform and Runtime Survey (we kept it short).

## Code examples

The DataStax Ruby Driver uses the awesome [Cucumber Framework](http://cukes.info/) for
both end-to-end, or acceptance, testing and constructing documentation. All of the
features supported by the driver have appropriate acceptance tests with easy-to-copy code
examples in the `features/` directory.

## Running tests

If you don't feel like reading through the following instructions on how to run
ruby-driver tests, feel free to [check out .travis.yml for the entire build code](https://github.com/datastax/ruby-driver/blob/master/.travis.yml).

* Check out the driver codebase and install test dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datastax/ruby-driver.git
cd ruby-driver
bundle install --without docs
```

* [Install ccm](http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/ccm-a-development-tool-for-creating-local-cassandra-clusters)

* Run tests against different versions of Cassandra:

```bash
CASSANDRA_VERSION=3.1.1 bundle exec cucumber # runs end-to-end tests (or bundle exec rake cucumber)
CASSANDRA_VERSION=3.0.0 bundle exec rspec # runs unit tests (or bundle exec rake rspec)
CASSANDRA_VERSION=2.1.12 bundle exec rake integration # run integration tests
CASSANDRA_VERSION=2.0.17 bundle exec rake test # run both as well as integration tests
```

## Changelog & versioning

Check out the [releases on GitHub](https://github.com/datastax/ruby-driver/releases) and
[changelog](https://github.com/datastax/ruby-driver/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). Version
numbering follows the [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) scheme.

Private and experimental APIs, defined as whatever is not in the
[public API documentation][1], i.e. classes and methods marked as `@private`, will change
without warning. If you've been recommended to try an experimental API by the maintainers,
please let them know if you depend on that API. Experimental APIs will eventually become
public, and knowing how they are used helps in determining their maturity.

Prereleases will be stable, in the sense that they will have finished and properly tested
features only, but may introduce APIs that will change before the final release. Please
use the prereleases and report bugs, but don't deploy them to production without
consulting the maintainers, or doing extensive testing yourself. If you do deploy to
production please let the maintainers know as this helps in determining the maturity of
the release.

## Known bugs & limitations

* Specifying a `protocol_version` option of 1 or 2 in cluster options will fail with a
  `NoHostsAvailable` error rather than a `ProtocolError` against Cassandra node versions 3.0-3.4.
* JRuby 1.6 is not officially supported, although 1.6.8 should work.
* Because the driver reactor is using `IO.select`, the maximum number of tcp connections allowed is 1024.
* Because the driver uses `IO#write_nonblock`, Windows is not supported.

Please [refer to the usage documentation for more information on common pitfalls](http://datastax.github.io/ruby-driver/features/)
